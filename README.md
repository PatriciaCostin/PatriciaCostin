### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Patricia, a junior iOS developer who is passionate about creating iOS apps and further improving my skills. On my GitHub, you can find the __Unsplash__ app I worked on during my internship at Endava, as well as the __WeatherApp__ app that I developed on my own with the goal of exploring Swift and the integration of SwiftUI in UIKit apps.
